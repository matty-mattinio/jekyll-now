(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>This lesson I learnt a lot about the python syntax. I felt that finding the simplest way to make this program was the best whey for me to see my mistakes. Through doing this I would be going through many steps and encountering many problems. I think this helps my learning because it makes me persevere to finish my program after making mistakes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited this lesson because of the fact that I did not understand some of the basics. When I started the code I wanted to get it finished without interruptions. A lot of time was spent not realising the simple mistakes I had made. I could have recapped the basics of python for 5 minutes instead of thinking blankly about why my code had an error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my next code, I will try to set myself a target. The target will be on something that I missed out or forgot to put into my previous code. This will help me remember the mistakes I made, and actually practice it afterwards. I will also improve my learning by making my code shorter so that the program will run quicker. This will be good practice because when the code get much bigger than the amount of code you have will matter a lot.</td>
