    <td>In this lesson I learnt about what I needed to achieve by looking at other students work. This helped me think about what my blog could change to and it gave me an example of what it would look and function like. I started to learn how to make a semi-transparent overlay and I am hoping to learn how to add photos to my blog.</td>

    <td>I need to work harder and put in more effort into the look of my blog and look for detail and unique things to add to my blog. I also need to stop just doing what I need to do and do over the minimum as I would get my blog looking very nice after a while.</td>

    <td>I will need to change my effort in lesson time and outside of lessons to help my improve my blog to be above standard. I will also add some pictures to my blog posts to make it look nice and to show my level of skill.</td>
