    <td>I learned because I wanted to work out things for myself this week because last week I had to ask my teacher for help but actually i could have worked it out myself. So in some occasions I either did work it out for myself or I did it independently by searching the answer on the internet .</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was the same as the last week which was i kept on crashing my spreadsheet so thankfully last week's copy was still available as I made a copy before everytime I edit the spreadsheet</td>

    <td>Next time I think that I will definitely try and make my spreadsheet go into 3 sheets so then that means that I can see everything easier and make my codes clearer.</td>
