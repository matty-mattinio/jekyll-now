    <td>In this lesson I used my ipad to take notes and I also used examples and ideas of my teachers who had very nice blogs. This strategy was effective as I could develop on their ideas to make mine even nicer.</td>

    <td>I need to be able to find my code easier as when I am in class as it would save me a lot of time which I could be spending on my blog and developing my website.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to find my code quicker and I will try to be more independent. I will do this by writing more notes about exactly how to find the code on my ipad.</td>
