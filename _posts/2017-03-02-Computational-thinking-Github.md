  <tr>
    <td>I learned by listening and thinking about what I was doing. The lesson was mainly about computational thinking, where we had to break down problems ourselves. We learned that there a processes going in your brain that you wouldn't ever have thought about if you didn't go through the stages of actually performing the task. An example of this was when we had to say a list of things we were doing while standing up from our chair.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by almost giving up when my program was not working. I eventually found out that it was as simple as me forgetting to put brackets in some places. I also need to work on not just copying the program that the teacher wants us to do, and to not understand why a lot of things are there for.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In order to improve my learning, I could revise and recap through all of the programs that we have learnt, maybe using CodeAcademy or other websites. This would have helped me solved my problem of not putting brackets, and would have given me an understanding of what was happening, and an ability of being able to make the code more developed.</td>
