    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was the fact that there were so many different gif's to choose from i had to choose one that was suitable and effective in my blog like my changing colour background ( I might of changed that as I might get insomnia). I also need to work a bit quicker as i was falling behind towards the end of the lesson.</td>
