    <td>In this lesson and at home I was introduced after a few years to excel. It is a very useful microsoft software that is not to hard to get used to. I took notes and photos to help me remember for when I got to doing it. This was useful otherwise I would have not been able to do the task.</td>

    <td>One thing that limited my learning was how I did this later than I should of. I should have done this on monday which would have left me with four more days to check it or ask for help. As I did this on thursday, it would have been a disaster if anything happened to it.</td>
