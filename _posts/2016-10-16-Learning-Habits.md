    <td>In this lesson I did not use my ipad to take notes as we were mainly having a discussion about how to have good habits for learning. I used some of the learning skills like having a positive attitude and being independent while working with my excel.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Some habits I need to work on is how I approach learning in terms of effort. I have noticed this with some of my peers, that everything like homework and any school work should be done with the least amount of time and effort. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to get inspiration from teachers and other sources and I will look at life differently. This will help as it will give me a different view and purpose to different things. I will also take notes while I do my learning as it would be useful when it comes to tests.</td>
