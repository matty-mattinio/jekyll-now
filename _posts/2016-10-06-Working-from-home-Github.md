    <td>I was ill this lesson, but still worked as if I was in the lesson except that I was at home. I did this in the morning as my brain was fresh and I was not tired, this helped me to work more efficiently.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I was not in school, I did not have a teacher to listen to or talk to. This limited my learning as I was not sure what I was supposed to be doing and how to do it.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will make the tables of my blog look nicer and have a better style to them to suit my overall website. I will hopefully prevent myself from getting a cold so that I will be able to go to the class.</td>
