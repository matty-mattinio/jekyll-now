I also had to experiment with colours to get a scheme that is visually pleasing and makes it so you can see my notes. *The colours I used may have been changed*</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I had to go onto W3schools website to help me with my coding but I could have easily done this himself, if I just had the time to work it out, I would have done more things and it would help me understand it more.</td>

    <td>Next time I think that I will definitely change the font as it is a bit boring at the moment so go to google fonts and from there i will change the font to a nice simple font that will add to the blog not make it hard to read it. Also I think I will also move my back ground further up the page.</td>
