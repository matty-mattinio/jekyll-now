I used my ipad so that I could type quickly and use apple notes.</td>

    <td>I need to work on remembering on what was said and not what is being written by me.
I also need to get through the starting stage quicker instead of taking ages to think about my username and my password.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will listen to what is being said more instead on looking down and typing on my ipad.
I will pick a password that I already use and I will pick a username that is almost certainly not going to be used again, but one that I will be able to remember.</td>
