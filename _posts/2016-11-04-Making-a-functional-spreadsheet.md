    <td>I was not in this lesson as I was away. I used classmates to help me to catch up. They showed me the notes they took down which told me some functions to use and what would make the process quicker. It was better in a way that I could talk with the other person and he was able to help me in particular bits.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One thing that limited my learning was the fact that I was not in the lesson. This limited my learning because I was not in a 1 hour long planned lesson. Another thing that limited my hearing was how (again) late I was to ask for this as I had forgotten most of what I had learnt from previous lessons and this slowed me down.</td>

    <td>First of all I would have liked to be in the lesson. I would change how quickly I act on catching up and working on my spreadsheet as it would help me having to repeat someone that I have already learned.</td>
